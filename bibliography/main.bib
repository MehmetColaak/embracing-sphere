    abstract = {Traditional oral storytelling has been predominantly limited to a live audience, augmented with voice acting, sound effects, and gestures. With new technologies, the reach of oral storytelling has expanded to allow remote listeners to tune in to radio programs and more recently to listen to podcasts and audio books, asynchronously. Digital tools offer easy-to-use applications that enable anyone the ability to not only narrate a story, but also to augment it in different ways, from adding sound effects in podcasts to narrating audio books with voice effects. In this work, we present a proof-of-concept system that allows oral storytellers to augment their storytelling with spatial sound effects. We present results from a preliminary study (n=12) that found the spatial sound effects to be vivid and immersive, indicating potential for semi-automated ways of augmenting oral storytelling.},

However, this article proposes to consider soundmaps through a narrative perspective, drawing on the field of interactive documentaries. Like soundmaps, interactive documentaries deal with issues of engagement, participation and interaction. In this sense, and according to Sandra Gaudenzi’s concepts, this article presents an analysis of more than 40 soundmaps focused on their modes of interaction.},
