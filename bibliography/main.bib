abstract = {Traditional oral storytelling has been predominantly limited to a live audience, augmented with voice acting, sound effects, and gestures. With new technologies, the reach of oral storytelling has expanded to allow remote listeners to tune in to radio programs and more recently to listen to podcasts and audio books, asynchronously. Digital tools offer easy-to-use applications that enable anyone the ability to not only narrate a story, but also to augment it in different ways, from adding sound effects in podcasts to narrating audio books with voice effects. In this work, we present a proof-of-concept system that allows oral storytellers to augment their storytelling with spatial sound effects. We present results from a preliminary study (n=12) that found the spatial sound effects to be vivid and immersive, indicating potential for semi-automated ways of augmenting oral storytelling.},

To understand experience and the user experience that results from interacting with products, designers conduct situated research activities focused on the interactions between people and products, and the experience that results. This paper attempts to clarify experience in interactive systems. We characterize current approaches to experience from a number of disciplines, and present a framework for designing experience for interactive system. We show how the framework can be applied by members of a multidisciplinary team to understand and generate the kinds of interactions and experiences new product and system designs might offer.},

    abstract = {The increasing number of haptic interfaces for musical applications offers opportunities to create new auditory-tactile mappings. However, the innate, bodily correspondences between music and vibrotactile stimuli remain unexplored and a challenge to articulate. In this paper, we investigate how new mappings can be created based on the somatic, felt experiences from vibrotactile devices. We utilize an embedded HCI method to collect, articulate, and document such bodily experiences through body maps. Through an exploratory workshop with mixed-background participants and a focus group analysis, the participants reported their bodily experiences using two categories of haptic devices on the body maps and ideated new mappings through co-design. Based on the results of these sessions, we report three annotated auditory-tactile mapping schemes, each of which offers different strategies. The themes that emerged in the workshop interactions help us examine implicit associations of auditory-tactile stimuli on bodily sensations and how body maps can be used to articulate these sensations while offering an opportunity to generate new ones.},

As a metaphor, “meandering” conveys the nonlinearity and digressive tendencies of essayistic thinking. With this chapter, I turn to a more literal (if technologically mediated) form of meandering: players wandering through the worlds constructed by video games. As players explore these vast spaces, they piece together a narrative on the basis of cues scattered in the environment.¹ This is what game scholars discuss under the heading of “environmental storytelling.” I will focus on a},
