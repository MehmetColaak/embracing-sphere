\chapter{Implementation}
    The Embracing Sphere installation is built into a physical car seat. When a user is seated, the system plays a pre-authored experience composed of synchronized audio and vibrotactile events. The following subsections detail the hardware and software components that sets the installation.\par

        As main processing unit of the playback system, a microcontroller Raspberry Pi 5 has chosen. Raspberry Pi is a small processing unit that can run traditional personal computer operating systems such as Linux. This small computer has chosen for its small form factor and GPIO pin usage.\par

        Playback system is interactive according to audience behavior with limits and some sensors required to use as a detection point. In that case a photoresistor used to detect if any user is seated or not by checking the light level coming to the sensor. If a user is seated, idling loop stops and main experience initiates.\par

        The audio channels that drives headphones requires 2 channels to play binaural audio which isolates the listener within the sonic environment and another 3 channels required to drive voice coil actuators.\par

        In total at least 5 channels needed to create this playback system that drives both auditory and vibrotactile parts of the installation. For 5 independent channels of audio output, ESI GigaPort EX sound device has chosen. Sound devices are hardwares used in recording and monitoring efficiently through ADDA (analog to digital, digital to analog) converters\cite{Sound_Reinforcement}. This sound device has 8 individual audio outputs and it is class compliant, available to use in linux systems like Raspberry Pi 5.\par

        These 8 analog outputs are line level -10 dBV RCA outputs which is enough to drive headphones but lack of power to drive bass shakers that needs 50w of energy to work. To amplify the haptic channels, Thomann t.amp S-100 MKII power amplifier selected.\par
