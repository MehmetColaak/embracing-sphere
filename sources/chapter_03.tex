\chapter{System Design and Methodology}
    \section{Conceptual Framework} Explain how user interaction, procedural generation, audio rendering, haptic rendering, and narrative elements connect in your system.
    \section{Procedural RIR Generation System} Detail the algorithms/methods used to generate RIRs (acoustic snapshots). What parameters influence them (e.g., simulated room dimensions, material properties, source/listener position)?
    \section{Audio Playback System} How are the RIRs applied (e.g., real-time convolution)? What audio engine/libraries are used? Output format (stereo, binaural, ambisonics)?
    \section{Haptic Playback System} Describe the haptic hardware (actuators, placement, controllers). 
    \section{Interaction Design} How does the user interact? What actions trigger the generation/playback? How is the narrative progression linked to interaction?
    \section{Narrative Structure} Explain how the environmental snapshots are used to convey the intended narrative.
