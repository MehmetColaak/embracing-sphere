    \section{Conceptual Framework}
        This section details the concept and design features of the Embracing Sphere installation. It describes the main conceptual components chosen and explains how they integrate to create an audio-tactile environmental storytelling experience.\par

        
    \section{Procedural RIR Generation System} Detail the algorithms/methods used to generate RIRs (acoustic snapshots). What parameters influence them (e.g., simulated room dimensions, material properties, source/listener position)?
    \section{Audio-Tactile Playback System} How are the RIRs applied (e.g., real-time convolution)? What audio engine/libraries are used? Output format (stereo, binaural, ambisonics)?
    \section{Narrative Structure} Explain how the environmental snapshots are used to convey the intended narrative.
